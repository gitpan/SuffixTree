PORTABILITY

This version uses a wrap file, suffix_tree_wrap.c, that was generated
for usage under Linux (we tested it only on Mandrake 9).

If you are using some other platform, you might want to generate your
own wrap file.

You need to have SWIG installed (get it from: http://www.swig.org/).

Now do ONE of the following (1 or 2):


[1]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
To generate a wrap file use the following commands from the directory
where the suffix tree source files (suffix_tree.h suffix_tree.c) are:

	cp SuffixTree.pm bak.SuffixTree
	swig -perl -module SuffixTree suffix_tree.h
	rm SuffixTree.pm
	mv bak.SuffixTree SuffixTree.pm
	
Now you need to do something that SWIG forgot, and that is to add the
following line somewhere in the beginning of the newly created wrap
file, suffix_tree_wrap.c

	#include "suffix_tree.h"
---------------------------------------------------------------------

-OR-

[2]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Run the following script:
		We will do this someday...
---------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION

To install (once your wrap file is compatible with your system), read
the instructions in the INSTALL file.
